## üöÄ About The Project

This repository explores the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare, focusing on two critical areas: **breast cancer** and **diabetes**. It leverages a multi-modal approach by analyzing both imaging data (Computer Vision) and structured tabular data (Data-Driven) to build robust diagnostic and exploratory platforms.

The project is divided into three main components:
1.  **Computer Vision for Mammography:** Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect breast cancer from mammogram images.
2.  **Tabular Data Analysis for Breast Cancer:** Applying classical machine learning models to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
3.  **Tabular Data Analysis for Diabetes:** Exploring and preprocessing the Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIMA).

## üî¨ Projects & Methodology

This repository contains three core projects, each detailed in its own Jupyter Notebook.

### 1. Mammography (Computer Vision)
- **Files:** `Mammography_processing.ipynb`, `Mammography_CNN.ipynb`
- **Goal:** To build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast cancer from mammography images.
- **`Mammography_processing.ipynb`:** This notebook covers all necessary preprocessing steps for the image data, such as resizing, normalization, artifact removal, and data augmentation, to prepare a clean and robust dataset for the model.
- **`Mammography_CNN.ipynb`:** This notebook implements the CNN model architecture (using PyTorch). It details the model building, training, using transfer learning, and evaluation process, concluding with performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 2. WDBC (Tabular ML)
- **Files:** `WDBC FULL PROCESSING 30.ipynb`, `WDBC_Processed.csv`
- **Goal:** To explore the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset and build a machine learning model to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- **`WDBC FULL PROCESSING 30.ipynb`:** This notebook provides a complete workflow, including:
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Feature engineering and selection
    - Training and comparing multiple machine learning models using Stacking approches
    - Evaluating the final model's performance.
- **`WDBC_Processed.csv`:** A cleaned version of the dataset, ready for modeling.

### 3. PIMA (Tabular EDA)
- **Files:** `PIMA Preprocessing and exploring .ipynb`, `PIMA_Processed.csv`
- **Goal:** To perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
- **`PIMA Preprocessing and exploring .ipynb`:** This notebook focuses on understanding the dataset, visualizing relationships between features, handling missing values, and preparing the data for future machine learning tasks. It serves as the foundation for building a diabetes prediction model.
- **`PIMA_Processed.csv`:** A cleaned version of the PIMA dataset.

## üîß Technology Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Python:** The core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis of tabular data.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For classical machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.) and metrics.
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** For building and training the Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **OpenCV (cv2):** (Likely used in `Mammography_processing.ipynb`) For image processing tasks.
